## Documentation for Multi-label Classification Model

This document provides an overview and documentation for the code that performs multi-label classification using a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow.

### Overview:

The code provided aims to perform multi-label classification on a dataset containing abstracts. The dataset consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` file contains abstracts along with labels for various scientific fields, while the `test.csv` file contains abstracts for which predictions need to be made.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Downloading and Extracting Dataset:**
   - The code begins by downloading a dataset zip file from a URL using `wget`.
   - The downloaded zip file is then extracted using `unzip`.

2. **Importing Libraries:**
   - Necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `re` are imported.

3. **Loading Dataset:**
   - The training and testing datasets are loaded into Pandas DataFrames (`train_df` and `test_df`).

4. **Text Cleaning Function:**
   - A function named `clean_text` is defined to preprocess text data. It converts text to lowercase, expands contractions, removes non-alphanumeric characters, and strips extra spaces.

5. **Preprocessing Text Data:**
   - The `clean_text` function is applied to the 'ABSTRACT' column of both training and testing DataFrames.

6. **Feature Extraction:**
   - The TF-IDF vectorization technique is used to convert text data into numerical features.
   - The `TfidfVectorizer` is instantiated with parameters `max_features=5000` and `stop_words='english'`.

7. **Model Training:**
   - For each target label, a logistic regression model is trained using TensorFlow.
   - Each label is treated as a binary classification task.
   - The model is trained using the training data, and accuracy is computed.
   - Predictions are made for the testing data.

8. **Updating Submission File:**
   - The probabilities of each label predicted by the model are added to the submission file.

### Usage:

- The code provided can be executed in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.
- Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`).
- The dataset URLs may need to be updated if they change.
- After running the code, predictions for each label will be added to the `sample_submission.csv` file.

### Dependencies:

- TensorFlow (for model implementation)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- scikit-learn (for text preprocessing and evaluation metrics)

### Conclusion:

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the code for multi-label classification using a deep learning model. By following the provided instructions, users can train the model on their dataset and make predictions on new data.
